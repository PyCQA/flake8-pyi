# This is an example .flake8 config, used when developing flake8-pyi itself.
#
# The following rules are incompatible with or enforced by black:
#       E203 whitespace before ':' -- scripts only
#       E301 expected 1 blank line -- stubs only
#       E302 expected 2 blank lines -- stubs only
#       E305 expected 2 blank lines -- stubs only
#       E501 line too long
#
# Some rules are considered irrelevant to stub files:
#       E701 multiple statements on one line (colon) -- disallows "..." on the same line
#       E704 multiple statements on one line (def) -- disallows function body on the same line as the def
#
# tests/imports.pyi adds the following ignore codes for that specific file:
#       F401 module imported but unused
#       F811 redefinition of unused name
