# This is an example .flake8 config, used when developing flake8-pyi itself.
#
# The following rule now goes against PEP8:
#       W503 line break before binary operator
#
# The following rules are incompatible with or enforced by black:
#       E203 whitespace before ':' -- .py files only
#       E501 line too long
#       W291 trailing whitespace -- .py files only
#       W293 blank line contains whitespace  -- .py files only
#
# Some rules are considered irrelevant to stub files:
#       E301 expected 1 blank line
#       E302 expected 2 blank lines
#       E305 expected 2 blank lines
#       E701 multiple statements on one line (colon) -- disallows "..." on the same line
#       E704 multiple statements on one line (def) -- disallows function body on the same line as the def
